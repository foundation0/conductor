ChatGPT™ is fantastic but its interface is not designed for professionals with multiple on-going conversations.

This is why we built Prompt: A privacy-first multi-modal* interface for AI-powered professionals.

Prompt is 100% open-source, decentralized*, community-driven software. Prompt has been designed as a modular platform* that anyone can extend. Modules can be anything from a new AI model to a new UI component. Module architecture is still in flux but we will be releasing more information soon.

## Watch Prompt in action 🎥

Coming soon 🚧

## Get started 🚀

Go to [beta.promptc0.com](https://beta.promptc0.com), create an account and you are good to go. 

Prompt is free and open-source, but you'll need OpenAI API key for the beta. Prompt's unified model engine is still in the works, so beta works directly through OpenAI's API. 

Or clone this repo and run it locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/promptc0/a0
$ cd a0
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
