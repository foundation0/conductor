ChatGPT‚Ñ¢ is fantastic but its interface is not designed for professionals with multiple on-going conversations.

This is why we built Prompt Conductor: A privacy-first multi-modal\* interface for AI-powered professionals.

Prompt is 100% open-source, decentralized*, community-driven software. Prompt has been designed as a modular platform* that anyone can extend. Modules can be anything from a new AI model to a new UI component. Module architecture is still in flux but we will be releasing more information soon.

> Conductor is Prompt's desktop user interface, designed for professionals who want to get things done using AI. Later this year, we will release Prompt's yet unnamed mobile interface, designed for individuals who want to bring AI into their everyday life. Both are built on Prompt platform, decentralized and privacy-first computing network that allows anyone to train and run AI modules.
